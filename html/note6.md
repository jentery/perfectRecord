# Automagical Transubstantiation 

For instance, according to both Nick Montfort and Matthew Kirschenbaum, a bias (in media studies and elsewhere) for computer screens enables an inattention to the materiality of computational processes and electronic texts. For more, see Montfort (2004) and Kirschenbaum (2008, 31-35). Montfortâ€™s term for this bias is <i>screen essentialism</i>.
