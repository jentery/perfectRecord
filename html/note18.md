# Office Records 

In <i>Files</i>, Cornelia Vismann (2008, 101) describes how the creation and organization of records is central to the work of offices and administration. Near the end of the book’s third chapter, she describes files as “the training ground for administrative routine.” That is, files are not simply the product or output of administration.
