# Exhibiting the Telegraphone 

For instance, the telegraphone received a gold medal at the 1900 Paris World Exhibition.

They also point out that “Poulsen no doubt sought to emulate Alexander Graham Bell, who had induced Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro to use his newly-invented telephone twenty-four years before at the American Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia” (1995, 16). Put differently:&nbsp;<span class="note" rev="scalar:has_note" resource="note28" rel="urn:scalar:version:28883">Poulsen and his research team</span>&nbsp;followed a long legacy of publicly dramatizing the potential of technologies at such exhibitions. Indeed, Poulsen’s 1900 demonstration, and Bell’s in 1876, are only two instances in a tradition of&nbsp;<span class="note" rev="scalar:has_note" resource="note29" rel="urn:scalar:version:28884">science fiction-esque performances</span>&nbsp;at fairs between 1850 and 1900.
