# Kennedy Is Not the Protagonist 

In the Kennedy collection, another volume, <i>Guy Garrick</i>, does not feature Kennedy as the protagonist. However, unlike Dunlap, Garrick is simply Kennedy with a different name. The Garrick stories are also scientific detective fictions and were published mostly in 1914. None of them appeared in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>.
