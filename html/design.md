# Smith's Projected Design 

In&nbsp;“<a href="media/possibleforms.png" resource="media/possibleforms" rel="urn:scalar:version:28305" data-size="medium" data-align="right">Some Possible Forms of Phonograph,</a>”&nbsp;he explains one use of magnetic recording could be a&nbsp;“<i>purely electrical . . . recording telephone</i>,”&nbsp;where people would speak into the phone, thereby vibrating a diaphragm that would convert sounds into an electric current (Smith 1888, 116). Varying in a length and intensity relative to the duration and amplitude of what was spoken into the diaphragm, the current—together with a magnetized cord—would pass through a helix. The helix would function as a recording coil, translating the current into&nbsp;“a series of short magnets grouped into alternate swellings and attenuations of magnetism”&nbsp;impressed on the passing cord (116). The cord would be wound through two parallel reels and put into motion by hand or clockwork. And it would be kept taut by a tension brake or spring pressed against one of the reels.
