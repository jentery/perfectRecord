# Phonograph Cylinder or Gramophone Disk 

I write “phonograph cylinder or gramophone disk” here because Edison did not demonstrate the phonograph disk until 1911. However, Emile Berliner filed his US patent for the gramophone on April 7, 1887. The word “disk” (as in “hard disk drive”), not “disc” (as in “compact disc”), is used in that patent and elsewhere when referring to Berliner’s storage medium.
