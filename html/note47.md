First circulating in 1930, the pulp magazine, <i>Scientific Detective Monthly</i>, was short lived. There were only ten issues (five before the magazine’s title was changed to <i>Amazing Detective Tales</i>). Reeve’s writing was frequently featured in it. He was also the magazine’s “Editorial Commissioner.” For more, see Locke (2007, 30-31).
