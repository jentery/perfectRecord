# Fidelity and Deceit 

Smith (1888, 116) hypothesized the results in aesthetic terms:&nbsp;“The cord . . . therefore contains a perfect record of the sound, far more delicate than the indentations in the tin-foil of the mechanical phonograph.”&nbsp;Not only would it be cheap and flexible; it could also&nbsp;<span class="note" rev="scalar:has_note" resource="note13" rel="urn:scalar:version:28787">“talk back”</span>&nbsp;if rewound on a reel and redrawn through the helix at roughly the same speed of recording. Importantly, though, a recording could occur on the receiver’s end of the telephone, too. For example, Smith (1888,&nbsp;<a href="media/possibleformsdetail.png" resource="media/possibleformsdetail" rel="urn:scalar:version:28336" data-size="medium" data-align="right">116</a>) writes:&nbsp;“our hypothetical young lady might, while listening to the impassioned pleadings of her chosen young man, be preparing the evidence for a future breach-of-promise suit.”&nbsp;Comments such as this one correspond with contradictions common to early representations of magnetic audio and the forms of listening it enabled: its noise-free character facilitates fidelity and deceit, immersion and distance, authenticity and disembodiment. By eliminating any audible mediation between a playback mechanism and its source medium, Smith’s inscriptionless process would enhance the clarity of communications <i>and</i> induce alienating effects.
