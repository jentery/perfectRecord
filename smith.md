# Responding to Edison's Noise 

In the history of technologies before and after 1888, a drive toward the abstraction and standardization of both information and perception is&nbsp;<span class="note" rev="scalar:has_note" resource="note9" rel="urn:scalar:version:28956">certainly nothing novel</span>. However, what makes the case of early magnetic recording unique is that Oberlin Smith bundled that abstraction and standardization with a critique of mechanical noise, which abraded cultured ears as it revealed technical flaws. One such flaw was the friction between a needle and groove caused during the playback of mechanically recorded sound inscribed on tinfoil. As magnetic audio historian Mark H. Clark notes in&nbsp;“The Magnetic Recording of Sound,”&nbsp;Oberlin Smith visited Thomas Edison’s&nbsp;<a href="media/menlopark.jpg" resource="media/menlopark" rel="urn:scalar:version:28317" data-size="medium" data-align="right">Menlo Park laboratory</a>&nbsp;in early 1878, ten years prior to his publication in <i>Electrical World</i> and just after Edison patented the&nbsp;<span class="note" rev="scalar:has_note" resource="note10" rel="urn:scalar:version:28784">cylinder phonograph</span>&nbsp;(1999c, 7).&nbsp;<div>

It was a noise that mechanical recordings simply could not avoid,&nbsp;and it&nbsp;<span class="note" rev="scalar:has_note" resource="note12" rel="urn:scalar:version:28786">offended Smith’s ears</span>. As a response, he proposed magnetic recording, where no audible, physical contact would be made between the storage medium (for example, thread) and the playback mechanism (for example, an electromagnet).</div>
